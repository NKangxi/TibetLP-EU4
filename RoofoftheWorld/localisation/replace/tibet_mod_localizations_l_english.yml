  bon_restoration.1.d:0 "Disapproval of the Church of Bon has spread across South and Central Asia as the result of pervasive corruption of monastic heads and priests. Voices cry out against the greed of the Church and even questioning its principles. A monk in $CAPITAL$ has for some time expressed deep concerns and is now declaring his discontent with the Hierarchy, paving the way for a dramatic convulsion within the faith."

  tibet_pragmatic_sanction.EVTNAME1:0 "The Sacred Tibetan Empire"
  tibet_pragmatic_sanction.EVTDESC1:0 "The Sacred Tibetan Empire, first reformed by Empress $EMPERORNAME$ in 1429, and the successor to the empire formed by Purgyal Gyalyum in 920, is a compromise borne out of decades of civil strife and legal conflict. The Empress Purgyal Lasya, who reigned from 1362 to 1417, was responsible for the successful conquest of the Third Han Dynasty by the year 1376. She was also responsible for violent campaigns against the nobility, and led bloody and fruitless campaigns against the Mongols and Timurids that exhausted the treasury. After her death, the empire fell into years of disunity, weakened by years of warfare, and nearly came to total ruin. The Empress $EMPERORNAME$, with a steady hand, prevented the total dissolution of the empire and negotiated a series of compromises with the remaining nobility and local elites. The result is a decentralized elective monarchy, comprised of cities, vassal kingdoms, church holdings, tribal confederations, and other distinct polities. The power of the Emperor or Empress is limited, and while the vassals of the emperor retain substantial autonomy they are sworn to each others' defense. An unwieldly solution, but one that has prevented further catastrophe and possibly the empire's complete dissolution."

Fuelled by the rumors that Gyalyum was planning to convert Tibet, Nagpoi and his supporters stormed Potala Palace in the morning of 17 May 1606. Gyalyum tried to escape through a window but broke her leg and was soon captured and shot. Her body was then cremated and the ashes reportedly shot from a cannon towards Ayutthaya."

  hc_bon_flavor.1.d:0 "Their Holiness, the Sacred Hierarch, has tasked a commission of trizins with addressing the challenges posed by the Protestant movement. While the Bon faith itself must not be compromised, Their Holiness and most local priests are willing to admit that some Restorationist complaints are valid. Therefore, the Council advises many changes to the administration of the Church, a stop to absentee Trizins and the worldly excesses of the clergy. In addition, several new monastic orders are to be founded, to aid in the efforts of the Counter-Reformation."

A treatise opposing this practice has been found nailed to a temple door with a very substantial relic collection. The opponents of this practice are hurting the unity of the one true path to salvation, the holy, universal and apostolic church, or perhaps they are right?"

To this day, there is a substantial community which emphasizes her divinity and her virtue, but the church has taken a muted tone on such discussions and says they may be even approach heresy, saying there was only one Tse."
