  tibet_pragmatic_sanction.EVTNAME1:0 "The Sacred Tibetan Empire"
  tibet_pragmatic_sanction.EVTDESC1:0 "The Sacred Tibetan Empire, first reformed by Empress $EMPERORNAME$ in 1429, and the successor to the empire formed by Purgyal Gyalyum in 920, is a compromise borne out of decades of civil strife and legal conflict. The Empress Purgyal Lasya, who reigned from 1362 to 1417, was responsible for the successful conquest of the Third Han Dynasty by the year 1376. She was also responsible for violent campaigns against the nobility, and led bloody and fruitless campaigns against the Mongols and Timurids that exhausted the treasury. After her death, the empire fell into years of disunity, weakened by years of warfare, and nearly came to total ruin. The Empress $EMPERORNAME$, with a steady hand, prevented the total dissolution of the empire and negotiated a series of compromises with the remaining nobility and local elites. The result is a decentralized elective monarchy, comprised of cities, vassal kingdoms, church holdings, tribal confederations, and other distinct polities. The power of the Emperor or Empress is limited, and while the vassals of the emperor retain substantial autonomy they are sworn to each others' defense. An unwieldly solution, but one that has prevented further catastrophe and possibly the empire's complete dissolution."

  ttot.EVTNAME1101:0 "Time of Troubles"
  ttot.EVTDESC1101:0 "The Time of Troubles stretched from the death of the last Tsenpo of the 1600-year-old Purgyal dynasty, in 1598, and the ascension of Tenzin I of the Khon dynasty in 1613. Famine, plague, public unrest and the appearance of false claimants plunged the country into a decade of turmoil as neighboring powers like Jin and Mongolia saw their chance to interfere."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1101:0 "Hard times are ahead of us"
  ttot.EVTNAME1102:0 "The Insanity of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
  ttot.EVTDESC1102:0 "The Insanity of [Root.Monarch.GetName] Over the last couple of months [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s erratic behavior has become an increasing problem. Some even say [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has gone completely insane..."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1102:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will rule until their death!"
  ttot.EVTOPTB1102:0 "Let their trusted advisor take over"
  ttot.EVTNAME1103:0 "Famine Strikes"
  ttot.EVTDESC1103:0 "The Tibetan famine of 1601-1603 was caused by three consecutive poor harvests. Widespread starvation followed, killing nearly a third of the Tibetn population. Refugees flocked to the capital, increasing economical and political disorganization across the country."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1103:0 "There is nothing we can do"
  ttot.EVTOPTB1103:0 "Try to ease the suffering"
  ttot.EVTOPTC1103:0 "Use all our resources to aim those in need"
  ttot.EVTNAME1104:0 "Plague"
  ttot.EVTDESC1104:0 "Following the suffering caused by the recent famine, an outbreak of plague now sweeps across the country."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1104:0 "There is nothing we can do"
  ttot.EVTOPTB1104:0 "Try to contain it"
  ttot.EVTNAME1105:0 "Brigands in [Root.GetName]"
  ttot.EVTDESC1105:0 "Recent famines and outbreaks of plague have left much of the country without functioning authorities. The province of [Root.GetName] has become a lawless land where bands of armed brigands roam the countryside terrorizing local population."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1105:0 "Restore authority"
  ttot.EVTOPTB1105:0 "Leave it be"
  ttot.EVTNAME1106:0 "First Gyalyum"
  ttot.EVTDESC1106:0 "During the Time of Troubles, a woman called Gyalyum appeared and claimed to be the reincarnation of the founder of the Second Tibetan Empire - and thereby the rightful claimant to the throne. This Gyalyum quickly attracted supporters throughout Tibet and especially in Ayutthaya. A few months later Gyalyum crossed the border into Tibet together with a force of Burmese, Thais and Tibetan exiles. It seems she already has strong support from our enemies."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1106:0 "Recognize her as the legitimate ruler"
  ttot.EVTOPTB1106:0 "Expel her"
  ttot.EVTTOOLTIP1106:0 "Gyalyum travels to [This.GetName] in search of support."
  ttot.EVTNAME1107:0 "False Gyalyum"
  ttot.EVTDESC1111:0 "A woman calling himself Gyalyum who claims to be the reincarnation of the founder of the Second Tibetan Empire has appeared and is claiming the throne of Tibet. The current ruler there has banished her and he is now seeking refuge here in [Root.GetName] to try and raise an armed force. This could be an opportunity to strike at Tibet without a formal declaration of war."
  ttot.EVTTOOLTIP1111:0 "Supply Gyalyum with some soldiers to support her invasion of Tibet"
  ttot.EVTNAME1108:0 "Gyalyum Returns"
  ttot.EVTDESC1108:0 "During her exile in [From.GetName] Gyalyum has managed to gather a lot of support for her claim to the throne of [Root.GetName]. [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has decided to take this opportunity to meddle in our affairs by supplying Gyalyum with troops. Marching for [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], he's rumored to be crossing the border any day now."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1108:0 "In time we will crush them both!"
  ttot.EVTNAME1109:0 "False Gyalyum Overthrown"
  ttot.EVTDESC1109:0 "The false Gyalyum wasn't able to hold on to the title of Tsenmo for even a year. A prince named Nagpoi Gyatso conspired against her. Fuelled by the rumors that Gyalyum was planning to convert Tibet, Nagpoi and his supporters stormed Potala Palace in the morning of 17 May 1606. Gyalyum tried to escape through a window but broke her leg and was soon captured and shot. Her body was then cremated and the ashes reportedly shot from a cannon towards Ayutthaya."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1109:0 "Resist these usurpers!"
  ttot.EVTOPTB1109:0 "Let the rebels seize power"
  ttot.EVTNAME1110:0 "End of the Time of Troubles"
  ttot.EVTDESC1110:0 "Stability and peace have once again returned to [Root.GetName] and the recent years of hardship known as the Time of Troubles are finally over."
  ttot.EVTOPTA1110:0 "A stronger [Root.GetName] will emerge!"
